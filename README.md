# BSV2025
Case study of a detailed data analysis of the GVZ data as a basis for the development of BSV2025. For a risk-based view, the first step requires overall overviews that allow conclusions to be drawn about the risk drivers (high proportion of overall risk). An overall view must be sufficiently detailed to be able to determine the granularity with which targets and measures must be determined. For this purpose, it is necessary to combine fire causes and building usage in the analysis. Causes are grouped into categories of similar fire initiation type to better identify levers in terms of action types (structural, technical, awareness, fire prevention, etc.).
